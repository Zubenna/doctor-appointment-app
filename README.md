# Book Appointment App
This is an app for booking appointments with a doctor. This front-end is built with react and redux. It connects to a backend API built with Ruby and rails which is hosted on Heroku. It fetches and sends data to the back-end using this API. The main function of this application is to display a list of doctor with different specialties, displays information about them and allow users to book an appointment with any doctor of their choice. Details like the doctor's full name, specialization, years of experience, location, email, phone number are displayed when users click on the picture of any doctor of their choice. From the doctor details page, the user can book an appointment with that doctor if he so wishes by clicking on the book appointment button. This opens a form that is auto-filled with the doctor's full name. The user will now select the date and doctor's location and submit his form. Users can go back to the home page by clicking on the HOME button on the left side of the page. He can also see a list of all appointments he has booked with different doctors by clicking on the appointments button still on the left column. On the home page, you filter doctors based on a specialty to make selection easy. The application pulls the information about the doctors from the backend API which I built and hosted separately on Heroku. This application is fully responsive.
NB: The doctors' pictures are free pictures selected from the internet and stored in the picture storing site [Imgur](https://imgur.com/). The picture links are now used as a string in this project. I have a plan of adding more features to this app in the future as well as create an admin dashboard for adding doctor details.
